## Introduction and Problem Statement (1 paragraph)
Genes are foundational to cell biology. Some gene may cause others to not be express, repress, some may cause them to be expressed more, activate, some may repress or activate themselves, or have no interaction with other genes. Key genes determine cell development. Considering many genes in a cell together, a (one-direction) network can model the interactions between the genes, where an edge may indicate activation or indicate repression. A large network of many genes is build up from network motifs between pairs of genes. Knowing these motifs, then, can inform development of large gene networks and and understanding cell development. The network links, however, not so clear that they can be observed directly. What can be observed is the number of gene A and gene B across many cells. These provide counts which may be transformed to estimate a bivariate probability mass function (pmf) for the two genes. The bivariate pmf for A and B is, in part, the result of the underlying motif. Predicting the motif based on the pmf may, therefore, be possible. The To this end, we used supervised machine learning to predict the motif given the pmf. This required that we know the underlining motif, so the Read Lab estimated the pmfs for the motifs using simulation. 

Prediction-modeling performance is pending.


## Background and related work (1 or 2 paragraphs)
Describe relevant scientific background and point to work that tried to solve similar problems in the past. Provide a few references to textbooks and/or research articles that describe relevant background. 


Stochastic models of gene regulatory networks have been tremendously influential towards understanding cellular heterogeneity and analyzing data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In order to further understand single-cell gene pair interactions, stochastic models have been used to produce gene-pair co-expression landscapes from a bivariate distribution (Gallivan et al. (2020)). Gallivan et al. have developed a family of stochastic gene-gene interaction models because existing single-cell data analysis techniques have mostly disregarded that pair-wise gene interactions can be deduced from the shapes of these landscapes (2020). Shannon Entropy, Peason Correlation Coefficient, Mutual Information, and a Coexpression Index were found to be relatively inaccurate predictors of landscape shape of a gene-gene interaction on their own, so the student researchers added mean and standard deviation to the list of features to train the models (Gallivan et al. (2020)). 

In another relevant article, Cao, J., Spielmann, M., Qiu, X. et al. have used scRNA-seq on two million cells from mouse embryo in attempt to obtain a more comprehensive view of the mouse oranogenesis cell atlas (MOCA) and developmental processes (Cao, J., Spielmann, M., Qiu, X. et al. (2019)). The student researchers have used the data collected for this experiment to visualize the gene-pair bivariate pmfs used for the stochastic models and to test whether the models trained on the simulated data can distinguish the motif of a landscape. 


## Data and exploratory data analysis
Describe what data set(s) you used in the project – include references (e.g., URLs) for where you obtained the data if you can.  This section should have considerable detail – make sure you include a good description of your data set(s), including size, dimensionality, types of variables, etc. 
Use figures (histograms, scatter plots, etc) and tables, but do not overwhelm the reader with too many plots and show only plots that provide interesting insights. In your writing, try to give the reader some intuition and sense of what your data is like.

### Experimental Data


### Simulated Data

## Methods
Provide a description of the technical/methodological approach that chose for your project. State assumptions clearly. 



## Resutls
Describe inferential and/or predictive results of your analysis. Try to avoid showing large tables and use graphics if possible instead. 


## Discussion and Conclusion 
Discuss what insights you gained from your project, in bullet form as follows:
- Provide summary of your findings
- What are limitations of your analyses? How can they be remedied in the future work?

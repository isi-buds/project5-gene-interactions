## Introduction and Problem Statement (1 paragraph)
A brief summary of your our project and your main results (essentially like an abstract for a technical paper). Be sure to define precisely what problem your project addressed and to motivate the problem, i.e., state the reasons to be interested in this problem.

## Background and related work (1 or 2 paragraphs)
Describe relevant scientific background and point to work that tried to solve similar problems in the past. Provide a few references to textbooks and/or research articles that describe relevant background.   

## Data and exploratory data analysis
Describe what data set(s) you used in the project – include references (e.g., URLs) for where you obtained the data if you can.  This section should have considerable detail – make sure you include a good description of your data set(s), including size, dimensionality, types of variables, etc. 
Use figures (histograms, scatter plots, etc) and tables, but do not overwhelm the reader with too many plots and show only plots that provide interesting insights. In your writing, try to give the reader some intuition and sense of what your data is like.

## Methods
Provide a description of the technical/methodological approach that chose for your project. State assumptions clearly. 



## Resutls
Describe inferential and/or predictive results of your analysis. Try to avoid showing large tables and use graphics if possible instead. 


## Discussion and Conclusion 
Discuss what insights you gained from your project, in bullet form as follows:
- Provide summary of your findings
- What are limitations of your analyses? How can they be remedied in the future work?
